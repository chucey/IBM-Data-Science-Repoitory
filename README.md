# IBM-Data-Science-Repoitory
This repository highlight my data science projects completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It contains Jupyter notebooks of the work that I've completed

## Machine Learning Jupyter Notebook:
In this project, I read a file containing the loan status of various people. The data set contained information about the person's gender, education, age, loan amount, loan status (Paid off or collected) and several other fields. T

I cleaned the cleaned the data including converting text to integers and text to dates. Next, I visualized the data to better understand the data. Lastly, I prepared the data to be used in the machine learning algorithm by selecting all necessary fields and normalizing the data. 

The goal of the project was to determine which classification alogorithm yeilded the best results so, this file was used to train 4 separate  algorithms: K Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. 

The training data was split into a training set and a testing set. I iterated each alogorithm to determine the parameters that yeilded the highest accuracy.

After training the models, a testing data set was used to determine which model was the best classifer. The evaluation metrics used were: jaccard score, f1 score and LogLoss Score.

Feel free to read the jupyter notebook for more details/
